            <p>How might we simplify providing access to treatment and coping resources for people with eating disorders during the pandemic?</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="concept-overview">
            <h1>Concept Overview</h1>
            <p>Therapea is an all-in-one platform that has the features of providing professional, community, and educational support. To provide access to treatment, we implemented a booking system for appointments with healthcare professionals as well as being able to those meetings. The education resource center ensures credible posts that are specifically tailored to those with eating disorders and differ from the generic content one might find online. The social platform within the app fosters a community where users can talk to people with similar experiences and validate each others' emotions and struggles. Having these three main features, Therapea aims to provide our users with different aspects of support conveniently on their phones.</p>

          <h1>Problem Space</h1>
          <p>According to a July survey by the International Journal of Eating Disorders, 62% of people in the US with eating disorders like anorexia experienced a worsening of symptoms as the pandemic hit. As we're living through the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe this is an important topic to address as these kinds of mental health issues are worsened during a pandemic. Thus, we thought of helping people with eating disorders in this on-going pandemic. Our aim is to create a solution that provides access to coping resources and treatment for people with eating disorders in a pandemic. With our project, we are looking to create more holistic access to resources in one platform by providing treatment options, education and coping resources, and a support system to help those with eating disorders during the pandemic.</p>

      <div class="brainstorm">
          <h1>Brainstorm</h1>
          <p>To tackle this issue, our team came up with sketches of possible ideas on how to help people with eating disorders. We had ideas of making a zine, a newsletter, or a physical product. In the end, we decided to roll with working with an mobile phone application since that would be the easiest way for us to reach our main users. If help can be right on their phones, it would make for a convenient and socially distanced way of help.</p>

        <h1>Contextual Inquiry</h1>
        <p>Our design is aimed at people struggling with eating disorders (people with eating disorders, recovering from it, and people who are just discovering symptoms) during a time of social isolation. The design of our app is specifically made to make the treatment/therapy sessions much more accessible and simpler. Our app allows for tailored treatment to the patients and professionals can focus on their specialties. In other words, patients will receive more specialized care.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“While I was going through these issues, I leaned onto talking to friends going through the same things, and also leaned on... people within my community who have gone through the same struggles”.</li>
            <li>“Therapy helped me a lot to come to solace and peace with the fact that everybody’s bodies can look different and that my body does not have to fit into the stereotypical body that I see across social media and elsewhere”.</li>

            <h1>Design Principles</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional Support</strong>: Users of our app can pick which therapist they want and sign up for virtual sessions. Through the video function, they can meet with their therapists without having to leave their houses.</li>
                <li><strong>Community</strong>: In our app, we plan to incorporate a chat system where users can talk to others who have also experienced eating disorders. In addition, a video function for users to have meals with one another virtually.</li>
                <li><strong>Education</strong>: Users of our app will have access to a forum board to ask and answer questions anonymously. Articles and videos posted are crafted by professionals themselves.</li>

            <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
            <p>Our team went through series of usability testing and research as we built our prototype. With some research and testing, we found multiple areas of improvements as well as some suggestions from our test subjects.</p>
            <p>More formulated survey => Adding options for survey</p>
            <p>Better visibility => Color contrast and emphasis</p>
            <p>Safety issues => Report and block options on friend profiles</p>
            <!-- <h2>Adding options for survey</h2>
            <p>Users said that the survey was a bit overwhelming and would benefit from having a drop down menu with answers </p>
            <h2>Make elements more visible</h2>
            <p>While using our prototype, our users said that they didn't realize some parts were interactive</p>
            <h2>Creating a report function</h2>
            <p>Some concerns that arose regarded the safety of our users and their ability to control who they want to be friends with</p>
            <h2>Make icons more intuitive</h2>
            <p>Our users said that some of our navigation bar icons were confusing and found it difficult to understand</p> -->

        <div class="high-fidelity">
            <h1>Final Product</h1>
            <p>In response to our research and what our users had said, we aimed for an all-in-one app that has better affordance and understanding of our users’ needs. In our high fidelity prototype, we incorporated five main interfaces: On boarding (login/signup, introduction, and survey), appointment booking, education resource center, friends+chat, and a main dashboard.</p>

          <h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>My first ever prototype! It was really fun being able to build a solution through design</li>
            <li>Design is an iterative process, it takes time and patience</li>
            <li>Interview and user test with not only your direct stakeholders, but also indirect stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the problem space and how your product affects them</li>
            <li>When collaborating with other designers, make sure everyone's thoughts are taken into consideration and find a way to reach a consensus or make compromises</li>
